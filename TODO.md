# TODO

This file contains some notes about things to consider for future development.

## Bitwise operations

And, or, xor, rot, etc

## Tracing

would be nice if we could trace execution

## Testing

a test suite would be nice

## I/O

Input functions and better output functions

## Floating point

Would be nice if we could do floats as well.

## Error Handling

Most errors are silently ignored. Fix that.

## syscall interface

might be nice
